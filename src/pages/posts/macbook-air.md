Macbook Air (13-inch, 2021) is my main computer for web development and everything else. It's really powerful and a great machine to create digital stuff. Mainly, its portable!

It has improved my productivity. I can take it with me on a vacation without worrying about the battery like most laptops struggle with. It is very light weight and has an aesthetic feel to it which improve the overall working experience.
